Student in Informatic Science, Etienne is working for the LIRIS laboratory, our partner. He has integrated Boot-Start to run an applied research mission. Etienne wanted to work on innovative subjects as Artificial Intelligence and Predictive Analytics. Very enthusiastic and curious, he brings dynamism and creative ideas to the R&D department and client projects. Of course, he provides a very good work as a coder on internal projects and in the evolution of our smart knowledge management platform.
