Quentin joins Boot-Start as part of his computer science formation at Epitech. Passionated since long about solving complex
problems, he missed a professional challenge equal to his logical mind. Technological diversity of Boot-Start's projects
match with Quentin's willingness and skills in Python, C, Angular, Java, Web and Elastic. He currently has to develop a
platform including a search engine and a smart recommendation engine for a client.
