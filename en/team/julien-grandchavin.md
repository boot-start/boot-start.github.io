After a computer science degree at University of Grenoble, Julien joins Boot-Start as an apprentice for his 5 yearâ€™s degree. Like Boot-Start, challenge is a real fuel for Julien. After many years as a professional sportsman in ski jumping, he needed a company as dynamic as him. Diversity of projects and technical challenges offered by Boot-Start were decisionali for this young IT talent. A few weeks of formation enabled him to be operational and be integrated to a major account project with advanced technical issues.
