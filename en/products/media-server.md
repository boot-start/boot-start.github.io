The Boot-Start Media Server is a RESTful service for managing the upload, storage, conversion and delivery of different media efficiently.
The generation of different media sizes is done on the fly if necessary. It can handle the upload of single or multiple media at the same time.
It can also allow the generation of derived media using a templating system. Boot-Start's media server is used in production by many of our clients.
If you'd like to try it out, feel free to contact us. We can make it available either as software you install and manage on your own servers or use the
instances installed on our servers as a software as a service.
