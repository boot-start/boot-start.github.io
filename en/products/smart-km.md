The Boot-Start Smart Knowledge Management platform is a RESTful service allowing to collect, clean, index data in order to provide search, recommendation and analytics on the input data.
It is still under heavy development and in the future we plan to include advanced data processing such as data deduplication, automatic cleaning, and more.
